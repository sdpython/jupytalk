    The unit test checking the notebook showing 
    lifelines recently started to fail.
    This was caused by a matplotlib update.
    Check `issue 191 <https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/lifelines/issues/191#issuecomment-145275656>`_.
    The issue is fixed on github but the module has not been updated yet.
    It can be fixed by manually updating the file 
    `plotting.py <https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/lifelines/blob/master/lifelines/plotting.py#L220>`_.
