    :title: Follow up on PyData in Paris

    I added some notes taken from others presentations
    during the second day of `PyData <http://pydata.org/paris2016/>`_:
    :ref:`l-pydataparis-notes`. This is my second PyData conferences
    and even if I missed on day this time (to prepare my slides),
    I've shared and learned.
    
    I particularly enjoyed the talk about the work 
    `scikit-learn <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html>`_'s 
    teams is doing to process issues and pull requests
    (see `The Scikit-Learn Day 2016: for enthousiasts, contributors and startup founders! <http://open-source-innovation-spring.org/scikit-learn-day/>`_).
    
    A couple of people insisted on the difficulty to hire people good in
    computer science, in computer and in science at the same time.
    I was wondering how I could talk about good practices in
    the software industry in my teachings in my teachings. 
    Maybe I'll start by reading and commenting 
    of couple of issues and pull requests from *scikit-learn* during a lecture.
    
    It turned out it was not so easy to find a page with the list 
    of core developpers for *scikit-learn*. The best page is 
    probably this one:
    `contributors <https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/graphs/contributors>`_.
    While looking for it, I discovered another library for RandomForest:
    `Boruta <https://m2.icm.edu.pl/boruta/>`_, implemented in Python by
    `Daniel Homola <http://danielhomola.com/2015/05/08/borutapy-an-all-relevant-feature-selection-method/>`_.    
    Some others links discovered during this search:
    
    * `Accelerating RandomForest in Scikit-Learn <http://www.slideshare.net/glouppe/accelerating-random-forests-in-scikitlearn>`_
    * `Six reasons why I recommend scikit-learn <http://radar.oreilly.com/2013/12/six-reasons-why-i-recommend-scikit-learn.html>`_
